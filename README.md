# cp16x8
Scrolling text displayed on an Adafruit 16x8 LED "backpack".

Scrolls a message, supporting full ASCII char set, on an Adafruit 16x8 LED "backpack"
(Adafruit https://www.adafruit.com/product/2042 or another color)

# Requirements
  * Aforesaid LED backpack - Adafruit part 2042 or equivalent (different colors have different part numbers)
  * A CircuitPython board to run it on - I used a spiffy new Adafruit Feather RP2035 but a much 'smaller' MCU will work fine (speed?)
  * I used CircuitPython 9.2.0, the latest at this time.
  * Adafruit/CircuitPython libraries:
    * adafruit_ht16k33
    * other libs as required by the above; adafruit_bus_device?

# TODO
  * NEED TO BE ABLE TO UPDATE THE TEXT !!!!!
